## What is this?

> Gatsby [themes](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/themes/) encapsulate all of the
> configuration and implementation details of Gatsby websites. This is a
> starter-kit (boilerplate) with a dependancy on the `@fr8/gatsby-theme` package.

## How do I use it?

Check out our quick
[getting started](https://@fr8/gatsby-theme.now.sh/getting-started) guide and
video!

`@fr8/gatsby-theme` at itâ€™s core relies on [mdx](https://mdxjs.com/) for page
creation. Check out the `src/pages` directory for some examples for using mdx.

A key feature of Gatsby themes is component shadowing. By simply placing a
component into the `src/@fr8/gatsby-theme/components` location, you can
override components used by the theme. You can read more about component
shadowing
[here](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/themes/api-reference#component-shadowing).
